# Weather App 

## Deployment
The site was deployed on Github Pages, and can be viewed [here](https://khalem.github.io/weather-app/)! 

## A little bit about the project

To continue my progress with React, I decided to build a Weather App. I thought this would be a great learning experience working with APIs in React.

I used Recharts to display the hourly data, and Framer Motion to animate the page. I will definitely look to use both of these in more detail in future projects due to their simplicity. I would also like to use Sass in more detail in future projects. There wasn't much need for mixins or any of the other useful features, but I decided to use it for structure.
